1. My main aim in RS School is to get as much experience in front-end development as possible   .
When  I studied at BSUIR 2 first years we learned basics of programming and try to do  some tasks on Java language.I always think that programming is something interesting and usefull in our life. So I started exploring this sphere and decided, that RS School would be a great way for me in achieving my goals. In future I'm going to become a decent web-developer, who is always in trend.
